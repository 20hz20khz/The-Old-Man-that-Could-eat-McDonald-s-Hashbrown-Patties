Once upon a time, in a restaurant 3 miles down the road, lonely old man ordered a quarter triple deluxe with all the mayo they had, with a side of hash brown patties (the McDonald's ones).
The restaurant server, named Jimmy, told the old man that this was McBobby's (the off-brand restaurant). The old man stared at Jimmy and told him that he changed his mind and returned the whole order.
And then he sued Jimmy, and became a billionaire.
This is the story of that old man, a billionaire with a unquenchable hunger for justice and hash brown patties. A vigilante that refuses to play by the rules.
What's his name, you ask? Well that's the thing... no one knows his name. They're all too afraid to ask him. Everyone just calls him... "The Old Man that Could eat McDonald's Hashbrown Patties."
