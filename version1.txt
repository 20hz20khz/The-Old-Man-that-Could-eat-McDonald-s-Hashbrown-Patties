Once upon a time, in a restaurant 3 miles down the road, lonely old man ordered a quarter triple deluxe with all the mayo they had, with a side of hash brown patties (the McDonald's ones).
The resturant server, named Jimmy, told the old man that this was McBobby's (the off-brand resturant). The old man stared at Jimmy and told him that he changed his mind and returned the whole order. 
And then he sued Jimmy, and became a billionare.
